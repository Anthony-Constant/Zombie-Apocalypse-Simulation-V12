ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE SIMULATION V12


WHAT IS IT? 

The agents in this model are HUMANS and ZOMBIES however, humans turn into zombies if they encounter a zombie and get bitten. 

Zombies are reflex agents that always attack when confronted by a human. Humans are rational agents that make decisions based on their immediate enviroment and the actions they can take at that moment.


HOW IT WORKS 

There are two main agents in this model, Zombies and Humans. The enviroment spawns two objects randomly anywhere on the map to help assist the humans to defeat the zombies. Food to regain their health when neccesary and weapons to have a fighting chance to defeat and kill the zombies. Food are denoted as a yellow fish icon and weapons are denoted as yellow 'x's. 

In addition, the humans own the following abilities: Robustness to become strong, Speed variation to increase speed and Vision cone to be able to see the zombies and flee. 

Furthermore, there are building/s that humans can pass through however, the zombies CANNOT pass through the buildings which makes the building a sort of SAFE ZONE for the humans. 

If a zombie wins a fight and reduces the humans health to 0 then it bites the human, and the human turns into a zombie. Otherwise, the human may flee from the zombie or fight and kill the zombie using their weapon to avoid becoming infected.
